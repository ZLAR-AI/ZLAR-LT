# Legal Notice — ZLAR-LT

**Effective Date:** March 2026
**Entity:** ZLAR Inc., a corporation incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act (CBCA)

---

## 1. Regulatory Classification

ZLAR-LT is a deterministic, rule-based policy enforcement tool. It does not use machine learning, does not make inferences from inputs, and does not generate predictions, recommendations, or decisions. It classifies actions via string matching against human-authored rules and blocks actions that match deny patterns.

Under the definitions established by the EU AI Act (Regulation 2024/1689, Article 3(1)), the OECD AI framework, the Colorado AI Act (SB 24-205), and other enacted AI legislation, **ZLAR-LT does not meet the definition of an "AI system."** Recital 12 of the EU AI Act explicitly excludes "systems that are based on the rules defined solely by natural persons to automatically execute operations."

ZLAR-LT is a governance tool that helps operators of AI systems manage risk. It is not itself an AI system. This distinction is legally significant: AI-specific regulatory obligations (risk tiers, transparency requirements, conformity assessments) do not apply to ZLAR-LT.

ZLAR-LT may assist AI system providers and deployers in satisfying obligations under Articles 9 (risk management), 14 (human oversight), and 15 (cybersecurity) of the EU AI Act. However, ZLAR Inc. makes no representation that use of ZLAR-LT satisfies any specific regulatory requirement. See Section 7.

## 2. Software Provided "As Is"

ZLAR-LT is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, and any warranties arising out of course of dealing or usage of trade.

ZLAR Inc., its founders, officers, directors, employees, contributors, and agents (collectively, "ZLAR Parties") make no representations or warranties regarding:

- The completeness, accuracy, reliability, or suitability of ZLAR-LT for any purpose
- The ability of ZLAR-LT to prevent, detect, contain, or mitigate any specific threat, vulnerability, or harmful action
- The continuous, uninterrupted, error-free, or secure operation of ZLAR-LT
- The compatibility of ZLAR-LT with any specific platform, tool, model, or runtime environment, including but not limited to Anthropic's Claude Code, Cursor, or Windsurf

## 3. No Guarantee of Containment or Governance

**ZLAR-LT is a governance tool, not a guarantee.**

ZLAR-LT provides policy enforcement mechanisms for AI agent tool calls. It is designed to classify risk, match against human-authored policy rules, and block actions that match deny patterns. However:

- **No governance system can guarantee containment.** AI agents may behave in ways that are novel, unexpected, or outside the design parameters of any enforcement mechanism.
- **ZLAR-LT does not control the AI model.** It operates at the tool-call layer. The model's reasoning, intent, and outputs are outside ZLAR-LT's enforcement surface.
- **ZLAR-LT does not replace human judgment.** It provides a structured mechanism for setting boundaries. The quality of governance depends on the policy rules in use and the diligence of the operator's oversight.
- **Agentic AI is an emerging technology.** The behavior of autonomous AI systems is not fully understood by any entity — including model providers, researchers, and governance tool developers. Users acknowledge this inherent uncertainty.

### Known Limitations

ZLAR Inc. discloses the following limitations in the interest of transparency:

- ZLAR-LT governs only the tool-call layer (framework hooks). Actions taken by AI agents outside the hooks protocol are not intercepted.
- The risk classifier uses pattern matching against known command signatures. Novel commands, obfuscated inputs, or encoding variations may not be classified correctly.
- ZLAR-LT is one layer of defense in a defense-in-depth strategy. It is not a complete security solution and should not be relied upon as the sole mechanism for AI agent governance.
- Cursor and Windsurf adapters are built from framework hook documentation and have not been tested against live hook payloads. The Claude Code adapter is verified.
- ZLAR-LT has not undergone independent third-party security audit as of the effective date of this notice.

This disclosure is provided to ensure that users can make informed decisions. It is not an exhaustive list of all possible limitations.

## 4. Assumption of Risk

By downloading, installing, configuring, or using ZLAR-LT, you expressly acknowledge and agree that:

a) You understand that agentic AI systems can take actions that are unexpected, harmful, or irreversible.

b) You understand that ZLAR-LT is a risk-reduction tool, not a risk-elimination tool.

c) You assume full responsibility for all actions taken by any AI agent operating on your systems, whether or not ZLAR-LT is installed and functioning.

d) You assume full responsibility for the configuration, deployment, and maintenance of ZLAR-LT, including the management of cryptographic keys and the review of audit logs.

e) You understand that ZLAR-LT has not been independently certified, audited, or validated by any regulatory body, standards organization, or third-party security firm as a sufficient governance mechanism for any particular use case, jurisdiction, or compliance requirement.

f) You are solely responsible for determining whether ZLAR-LT is appropriate for your use case, your regulatory environment, and your risk tolerance.

## 5. Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY ZLAR PARTY BE LIABLE FOR ANY:

- Direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages
- Loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or business opportunity
- Cost of procurement of substitute goods or services
- Damages arising from unauthorized access to or alteration of your data, systems, or transmissions
- Damages arising from the actions or failures of any AI agent, model, or system, whether or not governed by ZLAR-LT
- Damages arising from the failure of ZLAR-LT to prevent, detect, or contain any specific action, threat, or vulnerability

This limitation applies regardless of the legal theory (contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise) and regardless of whether any ZLAR Party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

**In jurisdictions that do not permit the exclusion or limitation of certain damages:** the aggregate liability of all ZLAR Parties for all claims arising from or related to ZLAR-LT shall not exceed the amount you paid to ZLAR Inc. for ZLAR-LT in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or CAD $100, whichever is greater.
